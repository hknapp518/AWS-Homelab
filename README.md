Deploying 3 machines in AWS to practice my defending and attacking on VMs. 


## Steps

Create an AWS topology outlining the cloud, the VPC which holds all of our VMs, and the public subnet where all of the machines will connect to the internet. The internet gateway is attached to the VPC and enables communication between the public subnet and the internet.
